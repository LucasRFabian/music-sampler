                    <p>Slipknot is one of the biggest metal bands of all time. After releasing their self-titled album in 1999, they instantly became one of the household names associated with the Nu-Metal era. Their second album, <em>Iowa</em>, was considered by many metalheads at the time to be the "heaviest" album ever released. Since then, the band is recognized by many as one of the most influential metal bands of all time, paving the way for heavier music. The band has been nominated for 11 Grammys and has won one.</p>
                    <p>Slipknot has been described as a "metal orchestra" because it has far more members than most traditional bands, many of which serve unconventional roles (Shawn "Clown" Crahan's primary role in the band is smacking a barrel). During performances, each member of the band wears a unique horrifying mask that reflects their own personality. Frontman Corey Taylor's versatile vocals give the band crushing rhythmic screams and soaring melodic vocals. Guitarists Mick Thompson and Jim Root add technical flair and create an inpenetrable wall of sound. The band has gone through three drummers, all of which are considered world-class.</p>
                    <p>The band is 25 years old at this point, and is still going strong. The legacy of Slipknot will undoubtedly be one of endurance and defiance.</p>
